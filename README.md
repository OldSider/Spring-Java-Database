# RESTful API development with Java, Spring Boot, Mock and Junit

- The project "RESTful API Development with Java, Spring Boot, Mock and Jest" aims to create a robust, scalable and high-quality RESTful API using key technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Mock and Jest. The application will provide services through a RESTful interface, allowing interaction with resources and data efficiently and securely.

### Main Components and Technologies:

### Java:

- Java is the main programming language used in the project, known for its versatility, performance and wide adoption in the development community.

### Spring Boot:

-Spring Boot is a framework based on the Spring ecosystem that simplifies the development of Java applications. It offers functionality to make it easy to create RESTful APIs, manage dependencies, automatically configure it, and more.

### RESTful API:

- The application will be a RESTful API, following design principles and best practices to provide access to resources in a standardized and easy-to-use way.

### Mock: 

-  The use of mocks allows you to simulate the behavior of system components or modules during unit tests. This is critical to ensuring the reliability and consistency of the code.

### Junit:

- Jest is a widely used JavaScript testing framework for unit testing, integration, and other types of testing in JavaScript-based applications, including front-end and back-end code.

## Key features:

### Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD):

- Implementation of the basic operations of creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources through the RESTful API.

### Entity Management:

- Implementation of functionalities for the management of different system entities, such as users, products, orders, etc.


### Database Integration:

- Use of a database to store and retrieve information, integrating securely and efficiently with the API.

### Automated Tests:

- Development of automated tests using Jest to ensure code quality, covering test cases for key application functionalities, including unit and integration testing.
